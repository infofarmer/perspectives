{"title": "Global Court Says Will Not Investigate Israeli Raid on Turkish Flotilla",

"article_text": "Comoros filed a complaint with the court in 2013, and, mindful of the sensitivity of the issue, prosecutors quickly agreed to a review. Mrs. Bensouda said Turkey and Israel were given the opportunity to provide information but had not done so.The outcome had been awaited with much interest, all the more so because the Palestinian Authority has been signaling that it may join the court. If it does, the I.C.C. may gain the authority to investigate a broad panoply of alleged war crimes in Gaza and the occupied territories.Although the prosecution rejected the case, its 60-page report included references to the alleged war crimes at sea and also called Israel the occupying power of Gaza, and seemed to offer the complainants some satisfaction.But Bulent Kahraman, the director of the Istanbul-based Humanitarian Relief Foundation, which had organized the flotilla, said at a news conference in Istanbul on Wednesday that he was disappointed by the decision, and that his agency would appeal. He had been given an early copy of the report before its official release on Thursday.The prosecution said the court could, in principle, claim jurisdiction over the case even though Israel is a not a member because jurisdiction applies to the vessels and aircraft of member countries as well as their territories. Three of the ships were registered in countries that were court members: Cambodia, Comoros and Greece.Experts said that while the report had no legal effect, it offered some insight into possible future cases involving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."}
