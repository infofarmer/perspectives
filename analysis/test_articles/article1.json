"article_text": "Turkey's Humanitarian Aid Foundation (IHH) issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) finished its investigation into the Mavi Marmara case and concluded that Israel is guilty of war crimes for attacking a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza in May 2010. In May 2010, Israeli commandos killed eight Turkish nationals and an American of Turkish origin in international waters on the Mavi Marmara, a ship leading a Gaza Freedom Flotilla carrying humanitarian aid and construction materials for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007. The IHH statement said the ICC will publish its decision in the lawsuit filed against Israel on Thursday. It also stated that a press conference will be held at the IHH's head office and will be attended by families of the victims of the Mavi Marmara and IHH President Bülent Yıldırım. The conference will inform the public about events that took place in the run-up to the court's recent decision and the future plans for the foundation and victims' families. The aid ship Mavi Marmara belonged to the IHH, whose legal committee along with representatives of the victims' relatives filed a case against Israel with the ICC in The Hague in October 2010. The ICC was unable to review the case as it only has jurisdiction over events that take place in the territory of its member states, and Turkey is not a member of the court. Lawyers representing victims obtained authorization from Comoros, where the Mavi Marmara is registered, to file a lawsuit against Israel on its behalf in May 2013. Subsequently the prosecutors of the ICC accepted the application and announced that the court would launch an investigation into the Mavi Marmara case. “The evidence of Israeli aggression was presented to the court. The accused include Israeli officials involved in the raid, including the Israeli prime minister, defense minister and the chief of staff of the Israeli military,” Ramazan Arıtürk, a lawyer for the victims, told the press in May 2013 after the ICC prosecutors accepted their application.Article 12(2) of the Rome Statute holds that the court has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board a vessel or aircraft of a member state, as well as its territory. The ICC has never before considered opening an investigation into Israel's actions. Since its establishment in 2002, the ICC has dealt only with cases involving hundreds or thousands of victims."}
