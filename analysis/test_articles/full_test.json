(photo credit:Wikimedia Commons) Fatou Bensouda, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, on Thursday rejected a request to open a full investigation against Israeli soldiers and leaders regarding the raid on theMavi Marmarain 2010.Comoros, a Sunni island nation located between Mozambique and Madagascar, had submitted the war crimes complaints and request for investigation.The Foreign Ministry had this to say: “Israel takes positive note of the decision by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to close the preliminary examination into the flotilla (Mavi Marmara).”The Jerusalem Post learned of Bensouda’s ruling before it was publicized, noting that her decision said that the incident did not rise to the level of severity of broad-based war crimes allegations that the ICC is empowered to deal with.In other words, the ICC deals only with cases where there was major fighting and war crimes allegations involving much larger numbers of deaths – as opposed to theMavi Marmararaid that involved nine deaths and a contained, short conflict on one vessel.Although there are still proceedings in Turkey on the issue, the ICC’s ruling likely puts the incident to rest after several Israeli, Turkish and UN-related reports have addressed the fallout from it.In May 2010, a group of foreign activists, along with a smaller group of activists from a Turkish NGO, IHH (which the quasi-government Turkel Commission Report identified as affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood) boarded several ships to try to break Israel’s blockade of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.While Israel commandeered and stopped most of the ships without incident, when Israel Navy commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara, IHH activists attacked them, leading to some commandos being wounded and nine deaths on the IHH side.Turkey and many others in the international community accused Israel of war crimes, but the Turkel Commission and the UN-sponsored Palmer Report cleared Israel of war crimes, validated some of Israel’s narrative of fighting in self-defense or said that there was not sufficient evidence to come after Israel for war crimes, even as the Palmer Report said that some of the commandos used excessive force.Comoros filed its complaint against the IDF and some Israeli leaders in May 2013, with scholarly briefs coming in for and against from a variety of sources since then.Many viewed Comoros as pursuing the issue on behalf of various IHH-Turkish contacts due to the law firm that filed the complaint.Despite rejecting the Comoros complaints, the ICC prosecutor’s decision included a number of statements against Israel’s position in terms of possible war crimes having been permitted and referring to Israel as a conquering power.Bensouda said that despite her final decision, that if the case had gone forward, “there is a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes” were committed by Israel during the incident.Noting Israel’s view that its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip nine years ago freed it from any argument of legally occupying Gaza, Bensouda wrote, “however, the prevalent view within the international community is that Israel remains an occupying power in Gaza despite the 2005 disengagement.”The Foreign Ministry responded saying, “It should be emphasized that the examination conducted was preliminary only, and the prosecutor decided to close the file without seeing a need to address the issue of resort to self-defense by IDF soldiers who were confronted, as mentioned in the report, by violence from IHH activists in the context of a flotilla which the prosecutor considered as not constituting a humanitarian mission.”The ministry statement continued, “It should be noted that any preliminary statement by the prosecutor regarding the conduct of IDF soldiers without addressing at all the central issue of self-defense which would justify the resort to force and without conducting a thorough investigation of the incident itself, is bound to lead to distorted and misleading statements.”The response also noted that Bensouda did not analyze the issue of complimentarity – meaning the question of whether Israel had investigated the allegations properly – an important point, since the ICC cannot intervene if a country carries out its own competent investigations.Earlier, the Post had learned that while Israel would have preferred the statements, about a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed, and the prevalent view within the international community regarding the issue of occupation, that when viewing the entire decision in context, these statements were considered qualified and to have little precedential value.

Despite declining to investigate on the ground of 'gravity', the ICC Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, recognises that the conduct of the Israeli forces constitutes war crimes and that characterises the situation in Gaza as an international armed conflict. It is clear that this decision is likely to anger the government of Israel further as despite its insistence that it is not occupying Gaza, the ICC Prosecutor disagrees and sets out the reasoning in her decision. It is, of course, disappointing for those seeking accountability for the Gaza Flotilla attack, but they will take some comfort in the decision only being grounded on the number of victims, not the conduct of the Israeli authorities as an occupying force. It is also quite clear that the ICC Prosecutor is setting the ground for the Palestinian Authority to ratify the Rome Statute of the ICC as whilst the number of victims in the Gaza Flotilla attack may be too few to justify aninternational investigation, the number of civilian casualties during Operation Protection Edge is well over 2,000. Gaza Flotilla Let's recall the details of the Gaza Flotilla attack. On May 31, 2010, a group of ships attempted to reach the Gaza Strip but were prevented from reaching their destination when members of the Israeli military attacked them in international waters. Nine people were left dead and scores seriously injured. It is clear - and this is confirmed by the ICC Prosecutor - that these acts constitute crimes under international law. To this day, the Israeli government has not been held accountable. The day is perhaps now synonymous with the Israel/Palestinian conflict. The 'Gaza Freedom Flotilla' was a group of six ships organised by six organisations. The aim of the flotilla was essentially threefold: to deliver humanitarian aid and construction materials; to break the blockade of Gaza; and to focus the world's attention on that blockade. Whilst in international waters, approximately 130km off the coast of Israel, the ships were boarded by at least 13 Israeli Naval Commandos from both speedboat and helicopter. The Mavi Marmara was the largest and lead ship in the flotilla, during the subsequent confrontation, the soldiers aboard the ship MC Mavi Marmara killed nine activists, and a significant number of others injured, some seriously. The argument raised by the Israeli soldiers being that they had acted in self-defence. This does not explain how the majority of those killed were shot multiple times, including in the back, and at close range. Gravity The incident was referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) by the Comoros Islands, as the state where one of the ships involved was registered, thus allowing a referral to the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) to be made - the Comoros Islands, unlike Turkey and Israel, have ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLYThe ICC Prosecutor has nowissued its decision, declining to investigate the incident on the basis of 'gravity'. The decision is disappointing in that respect; however, the decision must also be seen in a positive light given the conclusions reached. In the first instance, it finds that there is a reasonable basis to believe that members of the IDF committed war crimes. This finding in itself is a positive conclusion and can be effectively referred to in the case currently before the Istanbul High Court concerning the Mavi Marmara incident. Further, it can be referred to in any subsequent referral made to the ICC, should the Palestinian Authority become a State Party to the Rome Statute, as has been threatened should the UN Security Council fail to pass a forthcoming resolution demanding a retreat by Israel and an end to the blockade of Gaza amongst other demands. The issue of the occupation of Gaza is where there is arguably the most important conclusion in the decision. The ICC Prosecutor, in her decision, concludes that Israel is still an occupying force in Gaza. The reasoning is based upon the fact that it exercises complete control over border crossings, the airspace, and the sea. It enforces no-go areas within Gaza near the border, and it regulates the local monetary market based on the Israeli currency and control of taxes and customs duty. It is accepted that militarily, the IDF disengaged in 2005, however the argument put forward by Israel that it is not an occupying force is simply incredible and is rejected by the ICC Prosecutor. It is of significant importance that what has been argued by relevant members of the international community now has the backing of the ICC Prosecutor. This is of particular importance when considering that a further referral may be made should the Palestinian Authority ratify the Rome Statute and refer the numerous allegations arising out of Operation Protective Edge. Whilst the Gaza Flotilla incident may fall outside of the ICC's jurisdiction as having occurred before the ratification, the findings as to occupation will undoubtedly support a thorough investigation into the 50-day incursion. Israel is likely to react negatively to the decision given it consistently maintains that firstly, the IDF acted in self-defence on the Mavi Marmara, and secondly, that they are no longer an occupying force. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY No justification Israel is likely to react negatively to the decision given it consistently maintains that firstly, the IDF acted in self-defence on the Mavi Marmara, and secondly, that they are no longer an occupying force. Israel, however, must accept that international law is not on their side. It had no justification for its actions on the Mavi Marmara; it had no justification for its actions during Operation Protective Edge; and, it is deliberately enforcing subjugation of the Palestinian people by virtue of its blockade, and therefore its occupation. PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY There is a need for accountability; Israel has for too long failed to answer for its occupation of Gaza. Whether the Israeli authorities will be forced to answer at the ICC remains to be seen, and does appear to be wholly dependent on the forthcoming UN resolution, which the US is anticipated to veto given its steadfast support of Israel. However, if the resolution is not passed, Mahmood Abbas must carry through with his promise and ratify the Rome Statute. Justice has eluded the Palestinian people for too long, and likewise, Israel has been allowed to act with impunity for too long. The case of the Mavi Marmara may not be heard at an international court. However, the ruling is of significant importance and further supports the argument that the status quo cannot be maintained. The wind of change may finally be gathering speed. Toby Cadman is an international criminal law specialist.

Fatou Bensouda, chief prosecutor of the Hague-based ICC, on Thursday said that there would be no investigation leading to a potential prosecution because the alleged crimes, including the killing of 10 activists by Israeli commandos, were not of 'sufficient gravity'. 'The information available provides a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed on board the Comorian-registered vessel theMavi Marmaraduring the interception of the flotilla,' Bensouda said in a statement. 'However, after carefully assessing all relevant considerations, I have concluded that the potential case(s) likely arising from an investigation into this incident would not be of 'sufficient gravity' to justify further action by the ICC.' Nine Turkish nationals died when Israeli commandos staged a botched pre-dawn raid on a six-ship flotilla seeking to bust Israel's naval blockade of the Gaza Strip on May 31, 2010. A tenth activist later died of his wounds. 'Taking into account the serious nature of the physical injuries caused by the IDF's use of force against some affected passengers, and even bearing in mind self-defence ... the information available provides for a reasonable basis to believe that the IDF soldiers committed [a] war crime,' Bensouda said. Genesis of clash Israel imposed its blockade on Gaza in 2006 after Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, was seized there, who was eventually freed in 2011 in a trade for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The blockade was strengthened in 2007, when Hamas took control of Gaza, then eased somewhat following an international outcry over the killing of the Turkish activists. A Turkish court in May ordered the arrest of four former Israeli military chiefs over the raid as part of an ongoing trial in absentia brought by the Turkish group IHH and the victims' families in 2012. The assault led to widespread condemnation and provoked a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries. Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador, demanded a formal apology and compensation and an end to the blockade on the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas. An Israeli probe found that the raid did not violate international law, in a conclusion which Turkey said lacked credibility. 389 Content on this website is for general information purposes only.

Mrs. Bensouda said Turkey and Israel were given the opportunity to provide information but had not done so. The outcome had been awaited with much interest, all the more so because the Palestinian Authority has been signaling that it may join the court. If it does, the I.C.C. may gain the authority to investigate a broad panoply of alleged war crimes in Gaza and the occupied territories. Although the prosecution rejected the case, its 60-page report included references to the alleged war crimes at sea and also called Israel the occupying power of Gaza, and seemed to offer the complainants some satisfaction. But Bulent Kahraman, the director of the Istanbul-based Humanitarian Relief Foundation, which had organized the flotilla, said at a news conference in Istanbul on Wednesday that he was disappointed by the decision, and that his agency would appeal. He had been given an early copy of the report before its official release on Thursday. The prosecution said the court could, in principle, claim jurisdiction over the case even though Israel is a not a member because jurisdiction applies to the vessels and aircraft of member countries as well as their territories. Three of the ships were registered in countries that were court members: Cambodia, Comoros and Greece. Experts said that while the report had no legal effect, it offered some insight into possible future cases involving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
